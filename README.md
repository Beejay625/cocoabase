## Cocoa Chain – Plant, Track, and Grow

Cocoa Chain is a wallet-connected dashboard for planting, tracking, and visualising digital cocoa plantations. It runs on Next.js (App Router) with Tailwind CSS, Reown AppKit (WalletConnect), wagmi, Zustand, and Framer Motion.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Reown (WalletConnect) Project ID – create one at [reown.com](https://reown.com/) and copy the **Project ID**

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Replace the placeholder value with your Reown AppKit Project ID:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=REPLACE_WITH_REOWN_PROJECT_ID
   ```

This variable enables WalletConnect/AppKit across the app. Without it, the dashboard will throw an error on boot.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to see the dashboard.

The default landing page becomes the Cocoa Chain experience once the UI components are scaffolded (see project plan).
